# Subject Line Imperative Help
# A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
#
# If applied, this commit will your subject line here
# For example:
#
# If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
# If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
# If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
# If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
# If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch
# Notice how this doesnâ€™t work for the other non-imperative forms:
#
# If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
# If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
# If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
# If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods
